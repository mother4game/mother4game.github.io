                    <h1>Artists! We Need Your Help!</h1>
                </div>
        <p>So it’s come to this. Our team is relatively small, and we can only do so much. Additionally, we’d like to finish the game in a relatively timely manner, which isn’t something we can do with our team size. Being that the game's graphics are the biggest hurdle to overcome in terms of assets, we thought it'd be a good idea to bring on some more artists.</p>

        <p><b>If you'd like to give us a hand, DM us on twitter!</b> Samples of your work can help make things easier for the both of us. Keep in mind we won’t be able to offer payment, since this is a volunteer project.<p>
 <div class="row text-center">
                    <h2>Basic Prerequisites</h2>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>A fan of the MOTHER games. Goes without saying, but this is so you’ll know what we're talking about when we refer to certain things during development.</li>
                    <li>Understands and can replicate the MOTHER style, yet isn’t afraid to push things into a more unique direction.</li>
                    <li> Has a discord account (It’s how we communicate).</li>
                    <li>Is ok with not posting some of their or others work online (Most things are probably ok to post if it isn't spoilers, but run it by me just in case)</li>
                </ul>
             <p>And here are the open positions:</p>
        <h2>Map Artists</h2>
        <p><b>This is what we need the most right now</b>, since there's only one guy doing the tilesets, and two people making the actual ingame maps. We’re looking for artists who can replicate and elaborate on the MOTHER 4 map style. We’d like to speed up map production as well as revise some other maps to add more details and stylize things further. If you have experience with Tiled, and are ok with spriting assets in a MOTHER 2/3 esque style, but in a more stylized direction, then hit us up!</p>
 <div class="container-md mb-5">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-4 col-6 p-1 " >
                    <img src="content/teaser1x1.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-6 p-1">
                    <img src="content/teaser1x2.png"style="width: 100%;" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-6 p-1">
                    <img src="content/teaser1x3.png"style="width: 100%;" alt="">
                </div>
         <h2>General Sprite Artists/Animators</h2>
        <p>We’ll need more NPCS and animations/sprites specifically for cutscenes. It’d also be nice to have someone who can do more general art for the game too. We’re mostly targeting an expanded and more exaggerated MOTHER 3 style for these. If you’re comfortable doing whatever(NPCs, icons, ui assets, enemy sprites, misc) and know about how sprite sheets work, then contact us!</p>
 <div class="row text-center">
                    <img src="content/locals.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="">
                </div>
         <h2>Concept Artists</h2>
        <p>This is a fairly low priority in terms of recruitment, but it’d help a ton regardless. We’d mostly like to flesh out some locations, but designing new characters, iconography, and other such things would be nice too. If you’re able to do this alongside general sprite art, then that's even better! The concepts don't even necessarily have to be high quality artwork, since a simple MS Paint doodle is fine enough sometimes.</p>
         <div class="row text-center">
                    <img src="content/conceptual.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="">
                </div>
    <p>We won’t be responding to DMs right away, since we’ll need to evaluate who's best fit for the job and do some stuff behind the scenes to make the transition to our group more comfortable, but we’ll do our best to respond in a timely manner. We want to bring on a lot of artists, so even if you don’t think you’ll make it in, it's worth a shot to send us something. Thanks for your consideration and have a nice day!</p>
